# Telco Customer Churn Prediction with Explainable AI (XAI)

**An Explainable AI approach to predicting customer churn in subscription-based businesses using machine learning models and interpretable insights with SHAP & LIME.**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Masterâ€™s Capstone Project**.  
It focuses on predicting **customer churn** in subscription-based businesses using advanced **machine learning (ML) models** combined with **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques.  

By leveraging SHAP and LIME, the project not only achieves **high prediction accuracy** but also provides **transparent, interpretable insights** into customer behavior â€” enabling businesses to design effective retention strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Compare multiple ML classifiers (NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM).  
- Identify the most important customer features influencing churn.  
- Use **SHAP (global feature importance)** and **LIME (local instance-based explanations)** for interpretability.  
- Provide actionable business insights for customer retention in telecom and subscription-based industries.
